', '<p><b>&nbsp;Brief Introduction:</b></p><p>The most abundant substance  in our body after water is protein. Approximately one-sixth of human body weight consists of protein. Approximately one-third of the protein is found in muscle, one-fifth in bone and cartilage, one-tenth in skin, and the rest in various tissues. There are many types of proteins  in our body, each with its own unique structure and function. Proteins are found in all plants and animals and are important for life because nucleic acids are found in every cell of our body  and protoplasts are made of proteins. </p><p>&nbsp;<b>Composition of Protein:</b></p><p>Like carbohydrates and fats, proteins contain hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. Additionally, protein contains approximately 16% nitrogen. Some proteins also contain small amounts of other elements such as iron, cobalt and sulfur. Proteins are more abundant than carbohydrates and fats because their molecules are larger and they exist in different forms. Plants are an important source of protein. They convert ammonia and nitrates in the soil into protein. Herbivores eat plants and use plant-based proteins to meet their  protein needs. In addition to eating plants, people also benefit from milk and meat to meet their protein needs. </p><p><b>Structure and Classification:</b></p><p>All proteins in our body and in our food are called amino acids. Amino acids come together to form proteins through peptide bonds, in which the carboxyl carbon of one amino acid is attached to the amino group of another amino acid. This results in the formation of a peptide with a free carboxyl group at one end and a free amino group at the other end. Proteins exist in spherical or fibrous form. </p><p><b>A. Conjugated Proteins</b></p><p>Conjugated proteins are combinations of simple proteins and non-proteins. These combinations form complexes that are important for many physiological functions in the body. </p><p>Conjugated proteins include:</p><p>1. <b>Phosphoproteins</b>: Found in milk like casein.</p><p> 2.<b> Lipoproteins</b>: Proteins that bind to lipids  such as LDL, VLDL, HDL in plasma. </p><p>3. <b>Metalloproteins</b>: Found in ferritin and hemoglobin. </p><p><b>B. Simple Proteins:</b></p><p>Simple proteins only hydrolyze acids. These include globulin, gluten, albumin and albuminoid. Globulin and albumin are soluble in water and salt content and have negative anions in blood, serum and milk. The gelatin that is less soluble  in animals is gelatin.</p><p><b> Function of Protein:&nbsp;</b></p><p>The main function of protein is to form tissue. Protein is an important component of skin, bones, nails, teeth and hair. They are important for muscle growth and repair. Our body consists of 19% fat, 17% protein, 60% water and 4% minerals. </p><p><b>Bodybuilding:</b></p><p>Proteins are important for the structure of every cell. Since we cannot make proteins from basic elements like plants, amino acids are necessary for the formation of new cells. Protein provides the amino acids necessary to create new cells. </p><p><b>Sources of Protein:</b></p><p>Plants are important protein sources because they can produce protein from water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Animals use plants to meet their protein needs. Sources of protein include lentils, milk, eggs, meat, fish, cashews, oilseeds, chicken and farm plants. </p><p><b>Select:</b></p><p>Protein comes from many sources, including beans, milk, eggs, meat, fish, fruits and vegetables.

Dehydration can damage the skin  and increase the risk of premature wrinkles. </p><p><b>5.</b> It cushions the brain, spinal cord and other sensitive tissues. Dehydration affects brain structure and function. It  also plays a role in the production of hormones and neurotransmitters. Chronic dehydration can cause problems with thinking and feeling.</p><p><b> 6.</b> It regulates body temperature. When the body is hot, the water stored in the middle layer of the skin reaches the skin in the form of sweat. It cools the body when it evaporates. in motion.

The kidneys filter approximately 120-150 liters of fluid and remove approximately 1-2 liters of waste and excess water every day. The role of the kidney is to filter waste products and excess fluid from the blood. If the kidneys are not working properly, waste products and excess fluid can accumulate in the body. Untreated kidney disease can lead to kidney failure. The body is failing and dialysis or a kidney transplant may be required. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second  type of infection in the body. There are approximately 8.1 million doctor visits each year in the United States. Urinary tract infection will be more serious if the infection spreads to the kidney.

People with kidney stones have a higher risk of developing kidney disease. The biggest cause of kidney stones is lack of water. People who report these problems often do not drink the recommended  amount of water each day. If left untreated, chronic kidney disease can lead to kidney failure. The most common symptoms of urinary tract infections are pain or burning during urination and the need to urinate quickly.

', '<p>It is common for people to struggle with weight problems due to an unbalanced diet and a sedentary lifestyle. On the contrary, there are many individuals who are concerned about being underweight.</p><p>Losing weight can negatively affect your personality and self-esteem. Being too thin can also affect how others perceive you. Just as losing weight is difficult for many, gaining weight is not easy either.</p><p>Gaining weight requires consistent adherence to a healthy diet and lifestyle. The following foods help with weight gain:</p><p><b>1. Apples and carrots:</b></p><p>Carrots and apples are incredibly beneficial for health. If you want to gain weight fast, consume these two together. Grind equal amounts of carrots and apples and consume them immediately after lunch.</p><p><b>2. Raisins:</b></p><p>Raisins are very beneficial for weight gain. In combination with figs, they accelerate weight gain. Soak raisins and figs in water and consume them in the morning on an empty stomach. After a few days you will notice the difference.</p><p><b>3. Rice:</b></p><p>Rice is an affordable food that also promotes rapid weight gain. One cup of cooked rice contains 158 grams, 205 calories, 44 grams of carbohydrates and 0.4 grams of fat, along with iron. Rice can provide a significant amount of carbohydrates and calories per serving, making it suitable for those who struggle with hunger pangs.</p><p><b>4. Nuts and nut butters:</b></p><p>Nuts and nut butter are staple foods for weight gain. A handful of nuts contains approximately 170 calories, 15 grams of fat and 6-7 grams of protein. Include nuts in your daily diet as a snack or in various foods such as yogurt, shakes or crackers. Peanut butter and milkshakes provide approximately 270 calories, making them excellent high-calorie snacks.</p><p><b>5. Red meat:</b></p><p>Red meats like beef and pork are rich in nutrients essential for building muscle. For example, an 85-gram steak contains 24 grams of protein, 300 calories, and 2.5 grams of leucine, an amino acid vital for stimulating muscle protein synthesis and promoting muscle growth. Eating 45 to 50 grams of red meat a day can increase muscle mass and reduce the risk of age-related muscle loss.</p><p><b>6. Egg:</b></p><p>Eggs are among the best foods for building muscle. They provide plenty of protein and healthy fats, making them an affordable and tasty option. One large egg with the yolk contains about 74 calories. Consume whole eggs as they contain all the beneficial nutrients in the yolk.</p><p>If eggs aren\'t an option, consider using egg whites or egg substitutes in a variety of dishes, such as omelets, sandwiches, or French fries.</p><p><b>Conclusion:</b></p><p>Including these foods in your diet can help you gain weight in a healthy way. However, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet and lifestyle to effectively reach your weight goals.

', '<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disease that affects women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years). Between 2.2% and 26.7% of women in this age group have PCOS. Many women have PCOS but may not know it. In one study, up to 70 percent of women with PCOS were undiagnosed. PCOS affects the ovaries,  the inner layer of the uterus that produces estrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation. The ovaries also produce  small amounts of male hormones called androgens. The ovary releases an egg every month to be fertilized by the male sperm. This process is called ovulation.</p><div class=\"blog_imag\"><img src=\"https://dietirian.com/uploads/blog_posts/65f5920898ede.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><p><b>Hormonal Regulation of the Ovary:</b></p><p>The ovary is regulated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) produced by the pituitary gland. FSH stimulates the ovaries to produce follicles (egg-containing sacs) and then LH stimulates the ovaries to release larger eggs.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Key features of PCOS:</b></p><p>PCOS is a \"syndrome\" or symptom that affects the ovaries and ovarian function. Its three main features are:</p><p><b>1.Ovarian Cysts:</b></p><p>Many small, fluid-filled sacs called cysts develop in the ovaries. The word \"polycystic\" means \"many cysts.\"</p><p><b> 2.High androgen levels:</b></p><p> PCOS is often associated with high androgen hormone levels. </p><p><b>3.Irregular or Absent Menstruations:</b></p><p><b> </b>Women with PCOS often have irregular or no menstrual periods due to their ovaries.</p><p><b>Causes of PCOS:</b></p><p>Doctors aren\'t sure what causes polycystic ovaries. High male hormone levels  in women with PCOS are thought to reduce ovarian hormone production  and inhibit egg development. Reproductive system, insulin resistance, and inflammation have all been associated with excess androgen production.</p><p><b>PCOS Symptoms:</b></p><p>Some women may experience symptoms during their first menstrual period. Others  only become aware of their condition when they gain weight  or have difficulty getting pregnant. The most common symptoms of PCOS are:- Irregular menstruation- Heavy bleeding during pregnancy- Hair growth on the face and body (hirsutism) - Acne br&gt;- Weight gain or obesity - Male pattern baldness- Dark skin- Headache cover.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Diet Tips for PCOS:</b></p><p>Add baked or fish rich in omega-3, such as grilled salmon. -Use olive oil instead of sugar or margarine.  - Choose protein-rich beans and other non-starchy vegetables. - Brown rice, oats etc. Contains whole grains such as: - Eat whole fruits, not juice. - Eating foods high in fiber can help keep you full, aid digestion, and reduce blood sugar absorption.</p><p><b>Conclusion:</b></p><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome is a complex hormonal disorder that affects female development and causes many symptoms. Although the exact cause is not fully understood, genetic factors, insulin resistance and inflammation are believed to play a role. Management often involves lifestyle changes, including dietary changes, to reduce symptoms and improve overall health. It is important for women with PCOS to talk to a doctor about self-treatment and management strategies.</p>', 'Protein, introduction,dwarfism,  PCOS, cause of PCOS, hormones, diet of PCOS, feature of PCOS differentiation, oogenesis, premature overian failure, growth factor, cytokine, reprssor, holoprosencephaly, heparin-binding, proto-oncogene,mitogen, angiogenesis, wnt singling pathway, kinase, receptor, chemo taxis, host virus interaction, unfolded protein response, stress response, rna binding, amino acids, function of protein, source of protein, feature of protein, type of protein, benefits of protein, metabolism, small intestine, liver protein,covalent bond, essential amino acids, non essential amino acids dipeptide, fibrous protein, globular protein, haemoglobin, hydrogen bond, hydrolysis, quaternary structure, group, alpha helix, beta pleated sheet, tertiary structure, secondary structure,definition, hdl LDL, hydrolase, transfer as, disease varient, developmental protein, activator, dna-binding, transcription,transcription regulation, ', 'active', '2024-03-16 12:37:34', '2024-03-16 12:37:34');
